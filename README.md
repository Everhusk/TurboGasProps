TurboGasProps
=============

This program can be used to determine all fluid properties given two given conditions.  For example, given temperature and pressure, TGP can determine the density, enthalpy, entropy, etc. at that condition.  It can also be used to determine static conditions, given total conditions and speed, vice versa.
